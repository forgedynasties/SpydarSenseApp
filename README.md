# Spydar Sense

## Overview

Spydar Sense is an Android application designed to detect spy cameras using Channel State Information (CSI) and bitrate data collected via the Nexmon CSI tool on a Nexus 5 smartphone. The application leverages machine learning techniques to analyze the collected data and identify potential spy cameras in the vicinity.

This project is currently in the development phase and is compatible with the Nexus 5 equipped with the Broadcom BCM4339 chipset.

## Features

- **CSI Data Collection**: Utilizes Nexmon CSI to gather Channel State Information from Wi-Fi signals.
- **Bitrate Monitoring**: Collects bitrate data to complement CSI data for more accurate detection.
- **Machine Learning**: Employs machine learning algorithms to analyze the collected data and detect anomalies indicative of spy cameras.
- **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for setup, data collection, and detection.
